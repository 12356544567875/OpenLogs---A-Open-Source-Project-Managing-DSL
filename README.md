# OpenLogs
A Powerfull Project managing DSL (Domain Specifig Language) Designed for small and bigger project management with ease!

This also allows you to write projects with ease and quickly backing up your projects! Isn't it good ?

Not only this but it allows you to customise the language if you knew C++ and your open contributions are also good for improvements

# Tutorial
Starts with file extension - Open Logs doesnot has a fixed file extension but an OpenLogs code can be intepreted in any file format but commonly we uses .openlog for better file management.

## Macros
OpenLogs has inbuilt macros which are too powerfull for file and project management let's explore those 

### remove: (Macro)
<code>remove:</code> is an inbuild macro of OpenLogs which is used to remove the conent from any file without physically deleting it.

For example : I want to remove the content of a.txt or completly wipe out the data of a.txt so i can write
```OpenLogs
remove:a.txt
```
